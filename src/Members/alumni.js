              message="Hi guys! I would like to share some things which I was fortunate enough to come 
              across during my college life. Although I joined SAE as the standing President for the even
               semester of 2019-20 academic year, I learned a lot because of the challenges people in the
                core faced or rather were facing. Every situation or circumstance in your life teaches you
                 something. Eventually, this cognizance is highly regarded as experience which enables one
                to become astute and incisive. I would just say, people are opportune to face problems 
                and issues during their college life and come up with practical solutions, because 
                that is life, and no book can teach that. So, be vigilant and grab these opportunities
                by taking up challenges, through being a part of a club, participating in competitions,
                organizing events etc. Lastly, enjoy this segment of your life as much as you can, so
                that one day, you can reminisce those 4 yrs holding a beer in your hand on a beach in
                California. xD P.S. We did, and now it is your time to."

              Club can provide you the best platform to interact with same minded people effectively and
