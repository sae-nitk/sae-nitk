         It started off with a brief discussion about the COVID – 19 pandemic scenario until then: its causes, its effects on public health, effects on other sectors with a special focus on aerospace sector. “Equip or Enrich yourself” – a formula to gear up and make oneself future proof was discussed. A gist of how minds do actions and techniques to develop bare observations were covered. 
         Finally, all the participants performed a form of Buddhist meditation “Anapana Sati”, which translates to “mindfulness of breathing”. This 10 minute activity enabled the attendees to witness the real feeling of how effective meditation can produce a calm and relaxed mind.

The various toolboxes and the associated shortcuts were dealt with. Mathematical toolboxes such as sine, transfer functions, gain, display, etc., were also briefed. A simple step function was simulated in the model to find out the display functions of various trigonometric functions.
         The second phase dealt with certain advanced features and functionalities. PID controller and various tuning methods were discussed. The participants were introduced to various features of transfer functions of first and second order. Visualisation of graphs and optimization were also included in the KEP.
